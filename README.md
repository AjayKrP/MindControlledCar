# **Brain-Controlled Car for Individuals with Disabilities**  

This repository showcases an innovative project aimed at empowering individuals with disabilities who are unable to drive conventional vehicles. Using the **Neurosky Mindwave Mobile 2** headset, the system captures brain signals and processes them with **deep learning algorithms** to classify left and right directional commands for the car's movement.  

### Key Features:  
- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI):** Captures neural activity to enable hands-free control.  
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to classify brain signals into directional commands.  
- **Accessibility Focus:** Designed to enhance mobility for individuals with physical disabilities.  

This project demonstrates the potential of neural signal processing and machine learning in redefining mobility solutions. Explore the code and contribute to pushing the boundaries of accessible technology!
